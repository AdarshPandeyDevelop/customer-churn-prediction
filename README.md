# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Deep Learning model to predict customer churn using a banking customer dataset. The goal is to identify whether a customer will leave the bank based on demographic and account-related features.

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and follows a complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
